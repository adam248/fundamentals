# Disjoint Set

[Disjoint-set data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)



A disjoint-set data structure is useful in a variety of practical applications, including:

- Image Processing: In image segmentation, disjoint sets can be used to group pixels with similar characteristics together. This helps to identify and extract specific features from the image.
- Network Connectivity: Disjoint sets can be used to keep track of the connectivity of nodes in a network. For example, in a social network, disjoint sets can be used to group users based on their social connections.
- Computer Graphics: Disjoint sets can be used in computer graphics to group triangles that share common edges. This helps to optimize the rendering process by reducing the number of calculations required.
- Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm: Disjoint sets are used in Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. The algorithm uses disjoint sets to keep track of the connected components of the graph.

Overall, disjoint-set data structures provide a useful way to efficiently manage and group related data, making them a valuable tool for a variety of practical applications.
