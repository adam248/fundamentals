# Machine Learning (AI)

This is currently blowing up many a mind right now with ChatGPT distrupting the status quo.

This holds great promise in increasing the productivity of the planet, with reduced cost of time and energy.
A net improvement to humanity, if we are careful, as with any new technology, it can be just as easily be used against ourselves as to help us.

When we started using fire, we can use it to build wonderful things or destory many.
This is why we need to ask the hard questions of what do we really want to see happen?

AI and safety is the age old balance between freedom and security.
Humans completely crave both at the same time.
But to have more security generally means less freedom, and vice vesa.
This will always be the trade offs.
