# Frontend Design (UI & UX)

What can make or break your customers' hearts.

I currently consider [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to be the future of truly reactive frontend design.

My favourite course on EndUser Design was this course here: ***Broken-links:*** [Science of Great UI](http://www.sgui.com/).
This is the BEST introduction to understanding how to begin thinking about good UI and UX, before even thinking about a specific app or product idea.

I just noticed that the links to the course seem to be broken at the moment. Here is the up-to-date link. [The Science of Great UI on Deviq](https://deviq.thinkific.com/) and [The direct link to the course](https://deviq.thinkific.com/courses/the-science-of-great-ui)

It is a shame that this course seems to be hard to find.

I rewatch this course when I need to get back to the heart and soul of UI and UX.

Even though I disagree with Mark's belief light mode is better than dark. But for end users and general consumer applications light mode is better as it is what every one is used to. But if you are someone who is working in front of a computer all the time, dark mode means less eye strain, so in the end: KNOW YOUR TARGETTED AUDIENCE'S NEEDS!
