# Fundamentals

This is a repository where I build out and keep my current knowledge and code relating to key fundamental `soft` technologies.

This is both meant to be a reference for future me and a display of the subjects that I have knowledge in to others.

This is not representive of my total current understanding of these technologies as I have only been recently inspired to create this repo. I wish I created something similar a lot earlier in my dev journey.

This is designed with Github's UI in mind for easy reference and review.
