# Blockchain (Crypto)

The internet of value and digitized scarcity, which solves an age old problem of turning value into data itself.
In the old days we would rely on nature itself to provide scarcity in trading and markets (gold, silver, sea-shells).
Now we use intermederies and third-parties to validate scarcity (banks, courts, governments).

Now we can use code itself to replace vast parts of the banking system, legal system and even governments.
The nations that bravly adpot these new technologies (with careful consideration to consumer protection), will find that trade and commerce will become much more efficent and productive.
